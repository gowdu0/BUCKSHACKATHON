# Milwaukee Bucks Hackathon 2025

The Milwaukee Bucks are considering the introduction of four themed partial ticket plans for the upcoming season:

1. **Value Plan**: Focused on affordable tickets for weekday games.  
2. **Marquee Opponent Plan**: Featuring games against high-profile opponents.  
3. **Weekend Plan**: Highlighting weekend games for fans looking for weekend entertainment.  
4. **Promotional Giveaway Inclusive Plan**: Centered around games with promotional giveaways.

These plans aim to cater to diverse fan interests and purchasing behaviors. However, because these plans are newly introduced, historical purchase data specifically tied to them does not exist. Your challenge is to leverage **historical ticketing data** to predict the likelihood that an account will purchase one of these new partial plans and which plan they are most likely to purchase.
